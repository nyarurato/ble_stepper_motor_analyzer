rotate.sed is a sed script to rotate a library footprint CCW by 90 deg.
For 180 and 170 deg rotation run it multiple times.

It is useful to adjust footprint orientation to JLCPCB. If the 
automatic placement on JLCPCB requires rotation by X degrees, 
rotate the footprint using this script in the OPPOSITE direction to
compensate.
